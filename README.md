# CAHOOTS_CAD_Project
DSCI 410 Project evaluating the concordance between Dispatch and CAHOOTS
# CAHOOTS and CAD Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the concordance between dispatch (CAD) and CAHOOTS records, focusing on alignment, systematic differences, and occasional discrepancies. The goal is to improve the understanding and efficiency of emergency response systems.

## Research Questions
1. How well do the CAD and CAHOOTS call data align?
2. What systematic differences exist, particularly concerning racial demographics and specific situations?
3. What occasional discrepancies or outliers are present in the data?

## Data Description
This project uses the following datasets:
- call_data_from_CAHOOTS_2021_2022.csv
- call_data_from_CAHOOTS.csv
- call_data_from_CAD.csv

**Note:** The actual CSV files are not included in this repository due to privacy concerns.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Data Cleaning/Processing Steps
All data cleaning and processing steps are implemented in the Jupyter notebook.
